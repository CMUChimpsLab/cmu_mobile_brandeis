# Carnegie Mellon University - DARPA Brandeis Mobile Repository

This repository houses Carnegie Mellon University's contributions to the DARPA Brandeis Mobile research team.

The repo contains the following projects:
- Policy manager: The policy manager gives users fine-grained controls to configure privacy settings based on purposes and third-party libraries.

- Coconut (PE for Android enabled): Coconut is an Android Studio plugin, which annotates instances of sensitive data access and egress. In the PE for Android version, it also generates an app policy file, which is used by the policy manager to provide privacy controls to users. Coconut is an original work by Tianshi Li (https://tianshili.me).

    “Coconut: An IDE Plugin for Developing Privacy-Friendly Apps”. Tianshi Li, Yuvraj Agarwal, Jason I. Hong. In Proceedings of the ACM on     Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies, Volume 2 Issue 4, December 2018.

- Purposes document: Purposes give context to sensitive data access. Over the course of the project, we have developed a list of purposes from a number of projects and consolidated them into one single list.

- Policy manager demo app: This app demonstrates the policy manager's ability to detect a third party advertising library, and distinguish data accesses by their purpose by using an app policy.
